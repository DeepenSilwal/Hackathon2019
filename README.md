I used  _JavaScript_  and _Node JS_  for writing the code to parse the excel file to Json file. I used _NPM package_ to lookup different parsers. The parser file(exceltojson.ts) was created in _Typescript_ and then later uploaded to server in JavaScript. The code was then upload to _AWS_ server using _Lambda_ so that when the excel file was dropped in _S3 bucket_,  it would then convert the excel file to Json file and store it in different S3 bucket.
